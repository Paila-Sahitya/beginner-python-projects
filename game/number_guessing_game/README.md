# 🎯 Number Guessing Game

A simple Python command-line game where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- The program randomly selects a number between **1 and 100**.
- You enter guesses until you find the correct number.
- After each guess, the program tells you to go **higher** or **lower**.
- The game keeps track of how many attempts you took to win.

## 🖥️ Example Output
```🎯 Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
