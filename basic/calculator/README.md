# 🧮 Calculator

A simple **Python** command-line calculator that performs basic arithmetic operations — addition, subtraction, multiplication and division.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- The program prompts the user to choose an operation (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`)
- Takes two numbers as input
- Displays the calculated result
- Handles invalid inputs and division by zero gracefully
- Continues performing calculations until the user chooses to exit
