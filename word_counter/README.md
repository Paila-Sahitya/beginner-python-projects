# 📝 Word Counter

A simple **Python** command-line tool that counts the number of words in any given text.

---

## 🧠 How It Works
- The user enters a line or paragraph of text.  
- The program splits the text into words and counts them.  
- If the input is empty, it prompts the user to try again.  
- The user can repeat the process or exit anytime.
